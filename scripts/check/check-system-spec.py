"""CP1 system-specification and generation-derivation gate.

Validates every `contracts/system-spec/v1/systems/*.zti` against the component
specs it references, derives a `contracts/generation-manifest/v1` manifest from each, and
requires the derived manifest to be semantically identical to the committed
fixture it replaces — same components, same authority, same graph, same resolved
slots, same admitted bytes.

"Semantically identical" rather than "byte-identical" is deliberate and is
checked rather than asserted: the derived manifest is emitted in canonical
order, while the hand-authored fixtures carry the order they were typed in. Every
one of those sections is sorted by `build-generation.py` before it is encoded, so
the comparison below normalizes exactly what the builder normalizes and nothing
else. Any other divergence is a real one and fails.
